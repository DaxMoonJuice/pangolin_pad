Hello.

I'm using this repository to store code from tutorials on http://pangolinpad.wordpress.com, 
to backup my other projects and to store notes on things that I need to refer to every so often.

Directory breakdown:
  - Tutorials
      - Fairly self explanitory, here's where you'll find code discussed on http://pangolinpad.wordpress.com.
  - Backup
      - The code in here is designed for my own use & so may be a bit of a mess. Enter if you dare!
  - Notes
      - Miscellaneous folder for any useful non-code stuff I find.
